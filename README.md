## Overview

- this is a frontend mentor challenge

### Why this project?

- I chose this project because of it's because is a full one page website which will showcase my ability to build full page, it's footer flexbox challenge, the image slider feature and finally that pseudo background images making it beutiful.

### How do I get unstuck when am stuck

- Usually I go through the code and understand it finding the bug, or I went on searching in google for others solution compairing it with mine to see wich suited best.

### My process

- Because this is a ready-made design from frontend mentor challenge I just follow thier instruction converting their design into a full website.

### My challenges
